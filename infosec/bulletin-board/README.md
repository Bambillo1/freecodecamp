# Anonymous Message Board

It's a bit surprise when the FCC tests doesn't cover all the APIs, they only
care about some HTTP headers. So I don't put much effort here. Initially, I've
tried to build a web app similar to HackerNews (hence I wrote a lot of tests),
but it will took a lot of time. And I don't want to spend them.
