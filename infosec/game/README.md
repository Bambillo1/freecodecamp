## Complain

Some fun facts about this project:

- At the time I'm working on this, the
  [example game](https://secure-real-time-multiplayer-game.freecodecamp.rocks/)
  doesn't even work.
- We learned a bit about socket.io in
  [QA course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/#advanced-node-and-express),
  but none of the final project of QA is related to socket.io. And here we see
  it in the infosec final projects.

## Design

Let's build a game anyway.

First, what technology to use? We need to render a lot of things on a canvas.
