# Backend Challenges - Microservices course

The code is copied and modified from [here][fcc_ms_gh] for the [MongoDB and
Mongoose][fcc_ms] course.

[fcc_ms_gh]: https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mongomongoose
[fcc_ms]:
  https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/#mongodb-and-mongoose

Please don't expect that the code will work on my Heroku app. For this course,
the circle of edit, deploy then verify on FCC is too slow. I also don't want to
introduce more dependencies.

So I use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose my local server via internet, test
and debug locally.
