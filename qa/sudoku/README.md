# Sudoku Solver

Build for
[a FCC project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/sudoku-solver)

This problem is interesting since I used to think about building a brain game
like sudoku before. However, right now, there are a lot of sudoku games on the
market already. Thus, I don't want to put much time to polish the UI and make it
a playable game.

Total time for this: **3h**
